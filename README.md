Bookbot is a simple command-line program that reads text from a file and generates a report about the text.

Given a text file path as input, the program will generate a report of the word count, as well as the alphabetic character frequency regardless of case sensitivity.

For example:
<img width="454" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e178fc35-0412-4d12-9de0-0e7ca97f1cf9" />

This output is from the result of reading text from "frankenstein.txt", derived from the book of the same name by Mary Shelley.
